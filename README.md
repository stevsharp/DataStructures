# Data Structures

This repository contains implementations of various data structures in C#.

## Overview

Data structures are fundamental building blocks in computer science and software development. They provide efficient ways to organize, store, and manipulate data, enabling algorithms to perform tasks effectively.

This repository aims to provide clear and concise implementations of commonly used data structures, along with explanations of their functionalities and use cases.

## Implemented Data Structures

1. **Linked List**: Implementation of a singly linked list and a doubly linked list.
2. **Stack**: Implementation of a stack data structure using an array and a linked list.
3. **Queue**: Implementation of a queue data structure using an array and a linked list.
4. **Binary Search Tree (BST)**: Implementation of a binary search tree data structure.
5. **Heap**: Implementation of a binary heap data structure (min-heap and max-heap).
6. **Hash Table**: Implementation of a hash table (dictionary) data structure using separate chaining for collision resolution.
